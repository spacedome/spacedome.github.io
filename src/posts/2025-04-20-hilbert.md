Recently I thought: why are loading spinners such boring shapes, why not fill the loading space, surely CSS is capable of this? 
Thus was born the Loading Hilbert.
Here we show a simple iterate of the Hilbert curve in a square.
It is easy to imagine how we could do this for any curve, and even fill spaces dynamically with javascript if we were so inclined (this would certainly have performance constraints).
I have not seen anyone else do this yet, somehow, though it is pretty straight forward to do with an SVG and CSS animations.


<div>
<style>
    .spinner-container {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      margin: 2rem 0;
    }
    
    .spinner {
      width: 200px;
      height: 200px;
      position: relative;
      display: grid;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
    }

    .background {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      position: absolute;
      stroke: #f3f3f3;
      stroke-width: 2;
      fill: none;
      background-color: #E1E2F3;
      color: #E1E2F3;
    }

    .trace {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      position: absolute;
      stroke: red;
      stroke-width: 2;
      fill: none;
      stroke-dasharray: 500 500; /* 50-unit visible segment, 1486-unit gap */
      stroke-dashoffset: 1000;
      animation: trace 2s linear infinite;
    }

    @keyframes trace {
      to {
        stroke-dashoffset: 0;
      }
    }
